# Json-Translator
Manual translate for anything, check the input file and the new translated file and open a window to change the language of each value.

Place the file you want to translate in the input folder and change the "model_file_path" value to the path of your input file. Then, place the output file in the output folder and change the "translation_file_path" value to the path of your output file. You can then run the translator file and take hours to change every value of your json file!
